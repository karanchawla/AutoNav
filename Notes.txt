Kalman Filter

Properties of normal distribution: 
new mu = ( sigma2 * mu1 / N ) + ( sigma1 * mu2 / N )
N = sigma1 + sigma2 
new cov = 1/ (1/sigma1) + (1/sigma2)

Result is more certain than the original covariances. 

Assumption: 1. System evolves linearly over time and depends linearly on controls plus noise.(Gaussian with zero mean and cov Q)
	    2. Observation depends linearly on state plus noise. (Gaussian with zero mean and cov R)

A = n x n (n dimensional space)
B = n x l (l dimensional control, n=l fully actuated system)
C = n x k (observation is k dimensional) from the measurement equation 

Initial belief is gaussian, if no clue how to determine this then just set the mu to zero and a large covariance, meaning we are very uncretain about the initial belief state of the system. 
Motion model - prediction step 
Sensor model - correction step as the mu and cov are corrected by Kalman gain. 

Extended Kalman Filter 

Apply taylor series to motion and sensor models and apply similar formulae. Chapter 3- probablistic robotics.
